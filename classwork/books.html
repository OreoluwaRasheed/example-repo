				<h3>Love the way to Victory <cite>by Rev. Keneth Hagin</cite></h3>
				<p>
					Rev. Hagin teaches how to let the love of God dominate our lives
					rather than to allow our flesh or our unredeemed thinking to rule us.
					You can turn around even what seem to be impossible situations in your
					life--just by walking in the God kind of love!

				<h3>Smart Money Woman <cite> by Arese Ugwu</cite></h3>
				<p>
					The Smart Money Woman—An African girl’s journey to financial freedom
					Meet Zuri. She’s living a fabulous life. Great car, gorgeous
					apartment, well paid job. Meet Zuri. Broken down car, an apartment she
					cant afford, a job she’s about to lose. What’s a broke girl to do?
					With her best friends Tami (the flighty fashion designer), Lara (the
					tough oil and gas executive), Adesuwa (the conservative lawyer), and
					Ladun (the fabulous housewife), Zuri grows a little, learns a lot and
					navigates her way to making better financial decisions and building
					wealth. This book tackles, debt, spending, the consumerist culture of
					the African middle class, the fear and misconceptions surrounding
					money and the lack of it, love, friendships, cultural and societal
					pressures and the roles they play in success. With each chapter comes
					a Smart Money Lesson, there to help you work your way up the financial
					ladder.

				<h3>Scoin <cite>by  Kelly Oram</cite></h3>
					Russ Devereaux used to have it all—loving father, beautiful best
					friend, a carefree life in a town he loved, and strong magic. He was
					the king of his happy universe. Five months ago, that life was taken
					from him. Do not pass Go. Do not collect two hundred dollars. He’s
					spent months fighting back and building himself a new life, in a new
					city, with new friends he now considers family. But suddenly, his new
					life might be in jeopardy of getting shot straight to hell just like
					the last one. Literally, this time. He’s discovered power inside of
					him—an ancient, dark power that he shouldn’t have, can’t explain,
					can’t control, and definitely needs to keep secret. He needs answers,
					but before he can get them, he finds himself arrested and on his way
					to face the supernatural council. The same council that stole
					everything from him the first time. As Russ struggles to keep his new
					power under wraps, his old life and he new one are about to collide
					and it’s bound to be explosive. He may not have all the answers he
					needs, but one thing is certain: he’ll be damned if anyone is taking
					his new life from him. That is, if he’s not just plain damned.
